In 2014, Master Sha was recognized by the cities of Maui and Honolulu in Hawaii for his compassionate service to promote love, peace and harmony worldwide.

    <string name="about_movement_content">Love Peace Harmony Foundation was founded in 2006 and formally registered in the USA as a nonprofit in 2008. The mission of the Foundation is to serve all humanity and to make others happier and healthier. The goal is to raise the consciousness of humanity by chanting Love, Peace and Harmony to uplift the frequency and vibration of Mother Earth. On a practical level, the Foundation initiates and partners with other aligned organizations and nonprofits to offer assistance and support on numerous local and global humanitarian efforts.\n\nSome of the current projects range from "Peaceful Moms Healthy Babies" in Vancouver, musical concerts in Toronto to raise funds for local nonprofits; meditation, chanting and stress reduction for veterans with PTSD and formerly incarcerated veterans in Hawaii, USA; meditation and chanting for adults, children and mentally and physically disabled children in Mumbai, Bangalore and New Delhi, India; International Day of Peace celebration in Sydney and chanting for animals\' well-being in Sydney, Australia to name a few.\n\nThe Foundation also has partnered with other nonprofits to help make others happier and healthier in several countries. Most recently we supported WandAid\'s humanitarian work in Nepal to provide families with the resources to be able to rebuild their lives after the earthquakes in that country. Another partner in the project was the Roddick Foundation.\n\nThe Foundation has a prototype outreach program with Bhutan for developing countries and remote locations. This program works with children and families in isolated villages to support their access to education, healthcare and proper nutrition. The Foundation will be teaching the local villagers how they can use Master Sha\'s Four Power Techniques and chanting to help people maintain health and happiness. Also we will be bringing essential micro nutrients from our nonprofit partner, Vitamin Angels, to help malnourished children, pregnant women and lactating mothers sustain health and vitality.\n\nLove Peace Harmony Foundation is growing and we are looking forward to collaborating with more people, organizations and countries to be happy and healthy. We look forward to your support and collaboration.\n\nAddendum: The Divine Soul Song Love, Peace and Harmony has been credited with many deeply transformative experiences by the people who have experienced it, lowering crime rates, incidences of physical abuse, and improving the health for women in low income homes in Mumbai, as well as increasing children\'s intelligence and school performance. Chanting Love, Peace and Harmony for children in the slums of Mumbai (Dharavi, Asia\'s largest slum) also resulted in greater emotional balance, happiness and other emotional benefits. Many of these remarkable results are being documented now and a growing body of substantiable information is being gathered so that the benefits of this song can spread even wider.</string>

    <string name="about_song_content">Join together with 1.5 billion people to chant Love, Peace and Harmony by 2020.\n\nWhen many people join hearts and souls together to chant and meditate, this automatically creates a powerful field. We become what we chant, so as we chant to create world love, peace and harmony, each of us is transforming the message we carry within.\n\nLove, Peace and Harmony, a song received by Dr. and Master Sha from the Divine, carries the high frequency and vibration of love, forgiveness, compassion and light. Your body naturally resonates with this elevated frequency, and responds by activating love, peace and harmony throughout your being.\n\nBy 2020, we hope to inspire 1.5 billion people to sing Love, Peace and Harmony for 15 minutes every day. Your participation is absolutely essential to create world love, peace and harmony.\n\nTogether, we\'ll celebrate the power of the human spirit and its ability to transcend, transform and triumph to create miracles. Imagine a world where everyone holds the message of love, peace and harmony.</string>
